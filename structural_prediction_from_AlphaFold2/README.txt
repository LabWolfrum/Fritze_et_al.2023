In this repository, all structural prediction of the publication 
Fritze et al 2023 "Pathogenic variants in USH1G/SANS alter the protein 
interaction with the pre-RNA processing factors PRPF6 and PRPF31 of the spliceosome" are included.
Structural prediction was performed with AlphaFold2 (see material and methods part)

Description of the repository:
-The repository incudes multiple sub-repository with names matching to the publication
-each sub-repository includes at minimum:
	-the original derived AlphaFold2-multimer_v2 output
	-an analysis sub-repository including an .pse file of the rank 1 model for visualisation in PyMOL
-in addition sub-repository may include in the analyis sub-reporitory a .py file for visualizing predicted contacts by UCSF Chimera

-following abbrevations are used in therepositories:
